# Kmap-solver
A simple function to simplify boolean algebra expressions, inspired by [Karnaugh Map(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map).

# Introduction

A GUI java program that minimize the Function using KMap The Input is taken in Dialog Boxes as well as output along with display of Map on the frame.Input values to the K-Map table and get equivalent minimized boolean function as output.This application supports K-Maps for boolean functions of up to 5 variables. Don't care conditions are also supported.KMAP is an important aspect of digital logic design so it is made for an educational purpose.
